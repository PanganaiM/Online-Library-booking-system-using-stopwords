Online Library booking system using stopwords

The current library booking systems are based on names of authors and titles of their books, not on the concept of relevance of material in the book, so based on this the researcher seeks to identify relevance of material before a user proceeds with actually booking a textbook.

The proposed online library booking system works by utilising the stopword function in R and extration of key and relevant words which are mostly used in the relevant book. A user only has to select an option on the system which activates the count function which results in a display of the top 10 key words mostly used in the book concerned. These words become more informative hence a user is able to decide on whether or not to take the book based on this output. The option selected by a user is actually configured to the gutenbergr library in R as part of the working program for the textbook concerned.

The system is currently being developed, with the developer having started recently.
